## Introduction

TikTok has taken the world by storm, and I couldn't resist exploring its data to gain insights into engagement rates and even attempt to predict them. In this project, I utilized Jupyter notebooks and various data analysis and machine learning techniques to unravel the mysteries behind TikTok's success. 📈

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- 📁 **data**: This folder contains both the original data sources and the cleaned dataset that I used in my analysis and modeling.

- 📁 **notebooks**: Here, you can find Jupyter notebooks (named step 1 to step 4) that contain my data processing, model training code, and insightful analysis.

- 📁 **pic**: This folder showcases captivating visualizations from my exploratory data analysis. 📊

- 📁 **plan&slides**: In this directory, you'll find my initial capstone interest, progress standup presentations, and my final presentation. 🗣️

## Data

The data folder is split into two subfolders:

- 📁 **data/original**: Contains the original data sources as obtained from various reputable TikTok datasets.

- 📁 **data/cleaned**: Contains the cleaned dataset ready for analysis, ensuring that the data is in a suitable format for modeling.

## Notebooks

The notebooks folder holds the heart of my project. It is organized sequentially into four notebooks:

1. 📔 **Step 1**: Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
   - I dive into the data, clean it, handle missing values, and prepare it for analysis.

2. 📔 **Step 2**: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
   - In this notebook, I conduct exploratory data analysis to uncover patterns and trends in the TikTok engagement data.

3. 📔 **Step 3**: Feature Engineering and Model Training
   - Here, I engineer relevant features and apply machine learning algorithms to predict engagement rates.

4. 📔 **Step 4**: Model Evaluation and Conclusion
   - The final notebook evaluates the model's performance, draws conclusions, and provides insights for future work.

## Visualization

The pic folder houses captivating visualizations that emerged during the Exploratory Data Analysis phase. These visual representations offer a glimpse of the intriguing patterns hidden within the data.

## Plan & Slides

The plan&slides directory contains my project journey, from the initial capstone interest to progress standup presentations, and finally, the grand finale of my project - the final presentation.

## Project Highlights

- In-depth data analysis and visualization to understand TikTok engagement rates.
- Utilization of machine learning algorithms for predicting engagement rates.
- Interactive Jupyter notebooks for ease of understanding and reproducibility.
- Visual representation of insights and findings to captivate your interest.
